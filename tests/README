The whole thing is still a work in progress. There's not yet a true
"functional" test that you can run for example with nosetests or
lettuce.

Before doing ./run, you'll need on your XiVO:

* the following sccp configuration:

[general] 
vmexten = *98
dialtimeout = 4
keepalive = 60
directmedia = 0
language = fr_FR

[lines]   
[01]  
cid_name = Test01
cid_num = 01
context = default

[02]
cid_name = Test02
cid_num = 02
context = default

[devices] 
[SEP001122334401]
device = SEP001122334401
line = 01

[SEP001122334402]
device = SEP001122334402
line = 02


* the following dialplan:

exten = 01,1,NoOp()
same  =   n,Dial(SCCP/01)
same  =   n,Hangup()

exten = 02,1,NoOp()
same  =   n,Dial(SCCP/02)
same  =   n,Hangup()
