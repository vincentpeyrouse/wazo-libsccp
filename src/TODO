* sccp_new_channel: create new channel using values from line and device
* use line instance instead of the hard coded version
* use call-id instead of hardcoded one
* normalize line instance numbering, do not use offset
* de-allocate un-used structure and pointers (related to call hangup)
* refactor the actual code introduced since the last two commits
  (transmit_ functions should go into message subsystem)
  etc.
